I am a student in the Cognitive Science MSc program at the University of Trento and SISSA. I am currently working with the [Visual Neuroscience Lab](https://people.sissa.it/~zoccolan/VisionLab/Home.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Davide Zoccolan](https://people.sissa.it/~zoccolan/VisionLab/Personnel.html). I am currently looking for PhD & research opportunities in Europe in the fields of clinical and cognitive neuroscience.
