abstract: "The study investigated whether more linguistically complex VAS universally implies more cognitively difficult verb processing, as predicted by the Argument Structure Complexity Hypothesis. We hypothesized that this would only be the case at sentence level, whereas in single-word tasks more linguistically complex VAS would facilitate lexical access via lexico-semantic associations with potential arguments, contrary to the Argument Structure Complexity Hypothesis."
