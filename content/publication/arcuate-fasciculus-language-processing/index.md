abstract: "The connectivity between perisylvian language areas is subserved by the three segments of the arcuate fasciculus (AF): the long segment (AFlong), connecting posterior temporal and inferior frontal areas, and anterior and posterior segments (AFant, AFpost), connecting the inferior parietal lobule to inferior frontal and posterior temporal areas, respectively. Damage to the AFlong induces conduction aphasia, which manifests itself in impaired repetition likely due to a deficit in sensorimotor integration in speech. However, systematic investigations of the specific contributions of the three AF segments to language processing are lacking. The current study addressed the roles of these white-matter tracts in language production and comprehension at word and sentence levels. We found that lower volume of the AFlong following neurosurgery was associated with a greater deficit in language repetition, consistent with the tract’s role in sensorimotor integration in speech. Furthermore, we found that a postoperative decrease in AFlong volume was associated with lower postoperative sentence comprehension abilities. We did not observe any relation between postoperative decreases of the AFant and AFpost volumes, and language deficits. One plausible explanation is that these tracts are not critical for language processing, while the functions they underlie in healthy speakers demonstrate a greater capacity for reorganization during slow brain tumor growth, as opposed to those carried out by the AFlong."
