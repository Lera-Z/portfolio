abstract: "Patient studies and brain stimulation evidence suggest that language
  processing can be enhanced by altering the interhemispheric balance: namely,
  preferentially enhancing left-hemisphere activity while suppressing
  right-hemisphere activity. To our knowledge, no study has yet compared the
  effects of such bilateral brain stimulation to both logically necessary
  control conditions (separate left- and right-hemisphere stimulation). This
  study did so in a between-group sham-controlled design, applying transcranial
  direct current stimulation over Brocaâ€™s area and/or its homologue in 72
  healthy participants. The effects were measured not only in a
  single-word-level task but also in a sentence-level task, rarely tested
  previously. We did not find either any significant overall effects of
  stimulation or greater stimulation effects in the bilateral compared to
  control groups. This null result, obtained in a large sample, contributes to
  the debate on whether tDCS can modulate language processing in healthy
  individuals."
